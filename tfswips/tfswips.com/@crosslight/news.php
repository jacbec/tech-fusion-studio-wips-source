          <strong>The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts – Louisville, KY – Lobby  Lighting Renovation</strong>

          <img class="right-img img-responsive" src="images/KCA1.jpg" />

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>After  renovating all three performance spaces to full Sensor+ AF Dimming, ETCNet3  networking, and Paradigm architectural and Eos Family console control only  three years ago, Cross light was called upon again to assist with the  renovation of the lighting in the 130 foot long main lobby.  New York lighting consultants Focus Lighting  designed a new scheme for the lobby, replacing the old metal halide flood  lights with new Color Kinetics RGB LED fixtures.  The once green-white cylindrical ceiling is  now the canvas for multi-colored light shows and projected imagery.  Cross Light worked again with the site and  electrical contractors Ready Electric to provide a unified network control  system with ETC <u>Mosaic</u> and Unison <u>Paradigm</u>, speaking not only  ETCNet3, but also Color Kinetics’ KiNET directly to the LED fixtures and  Art-Net to the two High End DL3<u> </u>moving projectors.  Cross Light <u>APG</u> programmer Jonathan  Fuchs lead the nightly programming at the consultants’ direction, creating  dozens of various looks from subtle to high-impact.   This system also integrates a handful of new  and existing conventional dimmer racks and relay contactors to bring the  general lighting to the same point of control.</p>

          <strong>Northeast Christian Church - Louisville, KY</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>LED fixtures are not just for effect anymore.  When Northeast Christian Church in Louisville was unhappy with the dimming capabilities of their fluorescent houselight fixtures, they looked to warm-white Affineon LED Downlights.  To verify the light levels and coverage that the site desired, Cross Light utilized AGI32 calculations to provide point-by-point footcandle calculations from the Affineon IES files.  With that, the site was able to use half as many fixtures in existing locations to minimize new wiring, installation time, and power consumption.  The addition of DMX control allows full range 0-100% dimming and the ability to balance each fixture individually throughout the various heights in the room.  </p>

          <strong>Traditional Dimming – And Rigging Too! </strong>

          <img class="right-img img-responsive" src="images/muhlenburg.jpg"  height="190" width="287" alt="Wright State University" />

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>Incandescent dimming still has a place in the world.  Nowhere is that more clear than theatrical performing arts spaces like Muhlenberg High School in Greenville, KY or the new Eastern Kentucky University performing arts center in Richmond, KY.  Both sites recently installed new Sensor Dimming, Paradigm architectural control, and Eos-family consoles.  New to Cross Light is the addition of the ETC Prodigy line of motorized hoists.  Muhlenberg incorporates a full system of house light hoists, stage electric hoists, and general purpose batten hoists, all from a single point of control.  Also in Louisville, Valley High School and Western Middle School include front-of-house lighting hoists to compliment their ETC dimming systems, and improve access to theatrical fixtures without the need for a catwalk.  Valley High School’s new auditorium also includes the Prodigy Houselight hoists (pictured) to ease fixture re-lamping. Western high school added theatrical front lighting where none existed in the renovation of a decades-old room. </p>

          <strong>“Control, control, you must learn control!” - <em>Yoda </em></strong><br />

          <br>
          <br>

          <p> Sometimes a unique control situation arises where no solution exists yet.  At the Wright State University Creative Arts Center, theatrical consultants Jones and Philips designed a series of motorized acoustical drapes that hide behind acoustically transparent walls which allow for the dynamic modification of the sound properties of the room utilizing DMX-controlled DeSisti hoists.  Cross Light provided a unique preset-control solution in the form of a Mosaic Tessera touchscreen DMX controller.  From there, each individual banner can be proportionately positioned to adjust the tuning of the space.  All of the banners retracted allow the natural live sound for a vocal performance; fully deployed, they absorb the sound in the small space for a large orchestra; to everything in between. </p>

          <p>Electrical Contractor Cassady Electric called upon Cross Light to assist the owners in updating the building’s lighting systems during a major rehab and renovation. The domed ceiling of the former Sanctuary now incorporates ETC Selador Vivid fixtures to bathe the structure in anything from a warm glow, to soft pastels, to bright saturated colors.  Energy efficient quartz downlight fixtures provide lighting for any performance events that take place.  The 2nd space, the Auditorium, is now fully functional as a small performance space with a full electrics package of connector strips, Source Four PAR and Source Four Jr. fixtures.  The peripheral meeting rooms incorporate local architectural control over fluorescent and incandescent lighting provided by the building-wide system controlled by ETC Unison Paradigm networked processors and Sensor+ Dimmer Racks.  LCD touchscreens allow flexibility over the spaces, from color-picker screens, to combining breakout meeting spaces in the Auditorium. Localized button and fader stations provide simple control under day-to-day operations.  The lighting system integrates with other trades, controling shades in the auditorium, and overriding lighting circuits in the Sanctuary when the projection screen is lowered.  In addition, the main tower outside incorporates RGB floodlights run via an ETC Unison Mosaic show controller that plays colored light shows according to automatic holiday events, or a simple “candlelight” look on most days. </p>

          <br>

          <p>Theatre consultants Jones and Philips were called upon to light a Ginkgo sculpture in the lobby designed by the artist Warren Seelig.  They specified color-changing LED fixtures to be controlled by a Unison Mosaic show controller.  Cross Light provided hardware and programming services to turn the consultant’s vision into reality.  Cross Light also worked on the new Auditorium/Lecture Hall with a small ETC dimming system tied into the room’s AV Crestron control system.</p>

          <p>Utilizing DALI-controlled Fluorescent light fixtures, Leni Schwendinger of Light Projects Ltd lit the underside of the 2nd Street bridge in warm Red and Gold with a series of organic light shows that play on the hour.   An ETC Unison Mosaic controller with DALI-M expansion modules sends commands to the 70+ individually controllable ballasts, as well as controls a Unison Smartlink dimmer rack via DMX.  Strobe fixtures along the edge of the bridge are activated through contact closure outputs from the Mosaic to the proprietary strobe light controller to ensure the shows stay in sync.  Cross Light provided the ETC hardware and programming services with gracious assistance from Abby Tutorow.</p>

          <strong>Horizon Community Church – Cincinnati, OH</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>Cross Light worked with electrical contractor Denier Electric on three separate spaces to provide ETC dimming and control of both theatrical and conventional fixtures.  The main Chapel includes Paradigm architectural touchscreen control over Source Four theatrical fixtures and architectural loads on a Sensor+ dimmer rack as well as remote DMX control over fluorescent loads driven by Lutron Synergy panels.  An Ion Console in the main space controls those plus a mixed rig of conventional and moving lights.  The Paradigm system also interfaces with shade controls from the portable Touchscreen console to allow the lighting operator to raise and lower shades on the windows of the room.  A second Sensor+ dimming system runs the Youth and Elementary rooms, using Smartlink button stations for houselights.  ETC Smartfade ML consoles run conventional fixtures moving light fixtures in each room.  A Unison dimmer rack with Paradigm control runs the main lobby gathering area. </p>

          <p>Armstrong added a new Worship Center and youth room.  The worship center incorporates Sensor+ Dimming, Unison Architectural button and Touchscreen control, and an Ion Console.  The youth room uses a Sensor rack, Smartfade ML console, and Unison button and Touchscreen stations.  Both spaces also incorporate distributed DMX, for future moving lights in the main space and for smaller distributed dimming packs in the youth room.  Cross Light worked with Denier Electric on this project.</p>

          <strong>Paramount Theatre – Anderson, IN</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>The Paramount Theater in Anderson, Indiana experienced an incredibly unusual event.  A minor earthquake on December 30 broke a water main and caused water to pour into the main electrical distribution room under the theater.  As this room filled with water over the course of a four day holiday, the main distribution panel became submerged and began to boil the flood water.  Steam vented through the conduits that feed directly into the dimmer racks, melting the electronics within.  After an emergency call from West Electric on January 3, Cross Light inspected the damaged equipment on January 4 and determined a replacement system would be required.  Through an order placed with Indianapolis Stage on January 6, new equipment arrived onsite January 10.  Installed by January 13, main power was restored to the building through new switchgear, and Cross Light commissioned the new dimmer racks.  New button and Touchscreen stations were programmed the morning of the 14th, prior to performers taking the stage at 4:00PM that evening for their performance at 7:00PM.  Thanks to amazing support from ETC, and everybody involved working together so closely, the theatre was back up and running in a very short period of time.</p>

          <p>The university completed a new Theatre and Cinema building earlier this year. A 5,000 square foot black box theatre and 6,200 square foot television production studio have full ETC lighting systems.  Each space uses three SR48+ dimmer racks, Unison architectural control, ETC Ion consoles with wireless remotes, and distributed ETCNet3 networking.</p>

          <strong>Kentucky Center for the Arts, KY</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p>The renovation of the dimming and control systems for each of the three venues in the <a href="http://www.kentuckycenter.org/" rel="external">Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts</a> was completed in a tight two-month time frame this summer.  Working closely with the end user, the manufacturer ETC, the dealer/integrator <a href="http://www.onlocationls.com" rel="external">On Location Lighting Systems</a> and the local electrical contractor <a href="http://www.readyelec.com/" rel="external">Ready Electric</a>, Cross Light helped renovate three spaces to full ETC dimming, network, console and fixtures.  We provided drawing assistance to the owner and electrical engineer <a href="http://www.kerr-greulich.com/" rel="external">Kerr-Greulich</a>, as well as technical expertise with regard to specific hardware.  In the end, twenty-two existing dimmer racks were replaced with new Sensor+ AF racks, DMX distribution upgraded to ETCNet3 Gateways, and theatrical control replaced with ETC EOS, ION, and Element consoles.  The architectural control was also replaced with the new Unison Paradigm, to bring the entire facility under one manufacturer for the first time since its original construction.</p>

          <strong>On a Personal Note</strong>

          <br>
          <br>

          <p> Last summer, employee Jonathan Fuchs finally installed the pergola his wife had been asking him for since they moved in.  This pergola not only adds shade to outdoor seating areas, but also helps keep the living room and kitchen cooler in the summer from the afternoon western sun.  Still a form of lighting control, sun-angle calculations and renderings played a large part in his custom design of the neighbor-envied structure.</p>
